# Case Generation

The case graph is actually a directed graph with states combinations as vertices and transforms as edges.

Though the primitive states are very limited, the states combinations can result in an enormous quantity.

So one of the keys for test case generation is to reduce "unnecessary" test cases and make the process more efficient.

## How to tell "unnecessary" test cases out of many?
